steamkeysactivator
==================

Activates Steam Keys in bulks (Mac only)

It's a small and dumb script that reads currently open Safari page,
searches for Steam keys and uses local Steam client to activate them one by one.

It's particularly useful for Humble Bundles.

How to run:

    1) Check that you are using Mac OS and not Windows or Linux
    2) Download everything to your Mac
    3) Either run an application (more 3D icon) or 
       open a script (flatter icon) and press run in the up-left corner

Good luck!
Feel free to send patches and bugs!
